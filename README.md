# Battery Analyser

This Python script runs in the background and gathers battery data from the system OS and stores the battery percentage mapped with timestamps at which they were recorded. The time gaps between these snapshots can be user-defined. Ultimately these are stored in a .csv file format and plotted using matplotlib library as a line plot showing variation of battery percentage with time. This allows you to inspect battery health by providing necessary graphics.
